# Test-Time Adaptation for Skin Lesion Classification
Code for the paper "Test-Time Adaptation for Skin Lesion Classification".
The main code for evaluation is in the notebook "train_evaluate" and score-CAM analysis is done in "cam_analysis".

Codebase is based on parts of [T3A :link:](https://github.com/matsuolab/T3A)
Test-Time Adaptation implementations:
[SAR :link:](https://github.com/mr-eggplant/SAR) and [SHOT :link:](https://github.com/tim-learn/SHOT)

Augmentation is inspired by:
