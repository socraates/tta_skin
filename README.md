# Test-Time Adaptation for Skin Lesion Classification
Code for the paper "Test-Time Adaptation for Skin Lesion Classification".

The main code for evaluation is in the notebook "train_evaluate" and code for score-CAM analysis is in the notebook "cam_analysis".

The codebase is mainly based on parts of [T3A :link:](https://github.com/matsuolab/T3A) and test-time adaptation implementations are used of [SAR :link:](https://github.com/mr-eggplant/SAR) and [SHOT :link:](https://github.com/tim-learn/SHOT)

Augmentation is inspired by:
